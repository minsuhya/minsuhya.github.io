I really like using Markdown.


I think I'll use it to format all of  
my documents from now on. 

First line with two spaces after.   
And the next line.

First line with the HTML tag after.<br>
And the next line.


I just love **bold text**.  
I just love __bold text__.  
Love **is** bold


Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.  
Italicized text is the _cat's meow_.  
A*cat*meow   
*cat*


This text is ***really important***.   
This text is ___really important___.  
This text is __*really important*__.  
This text is **_really important_**.  
This is really ***very*** important text.

## Code Blocks

Code blocks are normally indented four spaces or one tab. When they’re in a list, indent them eight spaces or two tabs.

1. Open the file.
2. Find the following code block on line 21:
 
		<html>
		<head>
			<title>Test</title>
		</head>
 
3. Update the title to match the name of your website.


## Images

1. Open the file containing the Linux mascot.
2. Marvel at its beauty.
 
    ![Tux, the Linux mascot](/assets/images/tux.png)

3. Close the file.

## Lists

You can nest an unordered list in an ordered list, or vice versa.

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
    - Indented item
    - Indented item
4. Fourth item


## Code Blocks

To create code blocks, indent every line of the block by at least four spaces or one tab.

    <html>
      <head>
      </head>
    </html>

## Links

To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., [Duck Duck Go]) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g., (https://duckduckgo.com)).

My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com).


## Adding Titles

You can optionally add a title for a link. This will appear as a tooltip when the user hovers over the link. To add a title, enclose it in quotation marks after the URL.

My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com "The best search engine for privacy").
